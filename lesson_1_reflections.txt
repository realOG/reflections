How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?
Go back to the point prior to having errors in your code?

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google docs does?
Con- might forget to commit and can't get back to earlier version that could save you time.
Pro - avoid version cluster history so you find the appropriate version faster.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
So you can see logically how the multiple file commits are connected

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
Git to see all the commits and git diff to see the changes between commits

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?
There's a safe way to determine when the bug was introduced

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
Use it to start committing and debugging code.
