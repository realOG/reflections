When would you want to create a remote repository than keeping all your work local?
Remote repo allows you to back and share your code.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Sometimes you may want more granularity on the changes coming into your local repo to make sure it's synced properly.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
Forks are in copied repos in Github.
Clones bring repos in Github locally
Branches are copies of the same repo
